Mini Game Hub – Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe
The Mini Game Hub is a web-based project developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring two classic games: Rock Paper Scissors and Tic Tac Toe. It provides a clean, interactive interface where users can easily switch between games. In Rock Paper Scissors, the player competes against the computer, with delayed animations to enhance user experience. Tic Tac Toe offers two modes — Player vs Player and Player vs Computer, where the computer automatically makes smart moves after the player’s turn. The project emphasizes simplicity, responsiveness, and modular design. Deployed on Netlify via GitHub, it demonstrates core web development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic implementation, and responsive design, offering a lightweight and engaging gaming experience accessible across devices.
